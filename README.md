## My process

I wanted to try [this way](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/) of using SVGs. I was using inline SVGs until now, but it wasn't easy to manage when I had many icons in one HTML file.
I combined all the images in a single SVG file using `<symbol>`. I gived every `<symbol>` an ID so I can use it in my page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass ♥
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Custom Icon System

### What I learned

Today I learned how to create an icon system and how to use the *viewBox* attribute to scale my SVGs.

### Continued development
